### [Sentiment Analysis of Customer Satisfaction using Deep Learning](http://www.irjcs.com/volumes/Vol6/iss12/02.DCCS10083.pdf)

<p>The rapid advancement of web technology has led to an exponential increase in the volume of data present online for internet users. Travellers book their hotels only after extensive scrutinisation of hotel reviews on online websites. Hence, it is an absolute necessity for hotelâ€™s management board to gain insights from customer reviews and feedbacks to improve upon their services for a better customer satisfaction index. This research explores the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) powered by Google's Word2Vec skip-gram algorithm for customer sentiment analysis and review classification. The proposed model achieves a high test accuracy of 0.9248, with an average F1-Score of 0.925. Unsupervised sentiment clustering effectively classifies the reviews into four distinct categories and enables the Hotel Management to work out the major problems experienced by the customers.

### [Predictive analysis of customer churn in telecom industry using supervised learning](http://ictactjournals.in/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=4033)

<p>Customer acquisition and retention is a key concern for several industries and is particularly acute in fiercely competitive and fast growth businesses. Retaining a loyal customer is far more important than acquiring a new one, thus making customer churn one of the critical concerns for big corporations. Finding factors triggering customer churn is vital to implement necessary remediation to pre-empt and cut back this churn. This research focuses on implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify potential churn customers, categorise them based upon usage patterns, and visualize the analysis results. Results show that Extra Trees Classifier, XGBoosting Algorithm and Support Vector Machine have the best churn modelling performance, particularly for 80:20 dataset distribution with average AUC scores of 0.843, 0.787 and 0.735 respectively and low false negatives. The research demonstrates that ML algorithms can successfully predict potential customer churn and help in devising customer retention programmes.
